# Learned

* Haven't had to use bitwise operators in quite a while
* Poked around the standardlib for converting characters between encodings
* Reminded myself about hex, binary, base64 encodings and how to think about those (somewhat)
* I'm usually working at a higher level than shifting around bits in a byte
* The Base64 standardlib class was fun to read (Can look at java for ideas around naming methods and arguments)
